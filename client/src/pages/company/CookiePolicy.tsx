                                LinkedIn is a product provided by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland. Together with LinkedIn, we are jointly responsible for data processing in connection with our company profile, in particular in connection with the 'Page Insights' function in accordance with Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR. When you visit our company profile, personal data is processed by LinkedIn and us as data controllers.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                                LinkedIn has primary responsibility under the GDPR for the processing of Page Insights data, see also section bb) User analysis. LinkedIn therefore also assumes all obligations under the GDPR with regard to the processing of Page Insights data (including Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, Articles 15 to 22 GDPR and Articles 32 to 34 GDPR). LinkedIn remains solely responsible for the processing of such personal data in connection with Page Insights that is not covered by the existing Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum.

                                The purpose of operating our company profile on LinkedIn is initially to make contact with users and visitors to the LinkedIn social network and to engage in dialogue. In doing so, we provide direct information about our company and the associated offers.

                                As a LinkedIn profile user, we can process the data you provide as a LinkedIn member. This includes all information that you have stored in your profile, messages that you send us and interaction with our content. In particular, this happens when you share or recommend our content, comment on it, contact us or refer to our presence within LinkedIn.

This is so-called aggregated data that cannot be used to identify you personally. Data processing as part of the 'Pages Insights' service is the sole responsibility of LinkedIn.
