                                We process your personal data accordingly one or more of the legal bases, being: mostly the processing of personal data is necessary for:

                                    the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as, for example, if the processing is necessary for the delivery of goods or the performance of another service, the processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The same applies to such processing necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries about our products or services.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If our company is subject to a legal obligation to process personal data, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.) 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor is injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information needs to be transmitted to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Finally, the processing could be based on Article 6(1)(f) of the Regulation. This legal basis is used for processing not covered by any of the legal grounds mentioned above, if the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except when these interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject requiring the protection of personal data. Such processing operations are permitted because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. It considered that a legitimate interest can be presumed if the data subject is a client of the controller.

                            </p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-2 mb-4">
                                <li>We take all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that the personal data collected is minimal and relevant to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed. We will retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes stated in this Statement, unless otherwise extending the retention period is required or permitted by law.</li>
                                <li>We use cryptographic technologies to ensure the confidentiality of data transmission and storage and implement trusted protection mechanisms to protect data and data storage servers from attacks.</li>
                                <li>We deploy access control mechanisms to permit only authorised access to your personal data. In addition, we limit the number of authorized personnel and implement hierarchical permission management based on service requirements and personnel levels. Access to personal data will be logged and reviewed by authorised personnel on a regular basis.</li>
                                <li>We carefully select business partners and service providers and incorporate personal data protection requirements into commercial contracts, audits, and appraisal activities.</li>
                                <li>We organise security and privacy protection training courses, tests, and publicity activities to raise employees' personal data protection awareness.</li>

                                We are fully committed to protecting your personal data. Nevertheless, no security measure is perfect, and no product, service, website, data transmission, computer system, or network connection is absolutely secure.

                                In response to possible risks, such as personal data leakage, damage, and loss, we have developed several mechanisms and control measures, clearly defined the rating standards of security incidents and vulnerabilities and the corresponding handling procedures and established a dedicated Security Advisory and Security Notice page. We have also established a dedicated security emergency response team to implement security contingency plans, loss reduction, analysis, locating, and remediation, and to perform backtracking/countering operations with related departments in accordance with security incident handling regulations and requirements.
                            </p>

                                If any personal data security incident occurs, we (or the Data Controller) will notify you, pursuant to local legal requirements, of the basic information about the security incident and its possible impact, measures that we have taken or will take, suggestions about active defence and risk mitigation, and remedial measures. The notification may take the form of an email, text message, push notification, etc. When it is difficult to inform data subjects individually, we will take appropriate and effective measures to release a Security Notice. In addition, we will also report the handling status of personal data security incidents as required by supervisory authorities.

Please provide as detailed information as possible when submitting your request, such as the request type, specific content, information about the information holder (such as the account name you use for our products and services), and time frame in which the information was generated or processed (requests within a shorter period of time have a higher likelihood of being accepted).</li>
